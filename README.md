Examples used from:
https://blog.bitlabstudio.com/a-simple-chat-app-with-react-node-and-websocket-35d3c9835807

Minimal React boilerplate for testing (not included in repo):

How it works:
  - start server.js from from ./server/
    - node server.js
  
  - use chat components from ./client/src/ whereever you want
